# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
I built an app that allows users to view motivational messages in different ways. They can choose which type of message they would like to view, click a receive message, and view a randomly generated message. The user can favorite the messages they like, and view all the messages they have favorited. They can also remove favorites if they wwish. 

### Installation Instructions:
- Visit https://github.com/BrandonDoza/self-care-center
- Fork the repository.
- Select either SSH or HTTPS from the Code drop down, and copy the link.
- Navigate to the terminal on your computer.
- Navigate to the directory you would like to store the application.
- Type git clone "paste either the SSH or HTTPS link you copied here"
- Type code . to open the application in your text editor and view the code.
- Type open index.html in the terminal to view and interact with the application
in your browser. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
I had approximately 5 days to work on this project. I am 2 months into my coding journey at the Turing School of Software Design

### Contributors:
This project was completed solely by me

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize my programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
- I completed the minimum viable product relatively quickly. Approximately 
4 hours. 
- I am really starting to grasp the concepts executed in this project well.
- Learning how to implement local storage, so user generated information is still present on a page reload. 
Challenges:
- My biggest challenge was getting the favorite button to work like I wanted it 
to. I spent a good chunk of time trying different approaches. I'm not in love with the way I ended up doing it, but my other approaches just did not work the way I had envisioned. I will defintely revisit when I'm a little further along in my learning journey to refactor this portion and get it to do exactly what I want.
