// Restate the goal: 
// I need to build a web app that will allow users to recieve a self care 
// message. They should be able to select the type of message they want 
// to recieve, click a button, and then see a randomly generated message
// Data Types: 
// I need have a data model - this will be an array or arrays that store the 
// messages in them
// I will be working with strings - these will be the messages
// I will be working with radio buttons
// Questiions:
// is it better to use innerHTML or createElement and then appendChild when 
// displaying something to the DOM?
// should I be using display: hidden for the image currently in the output
// how do I read the value of a radio button? or see if it is checked?
// Psuedocode:
// I need 2 arrays that will store the message strings
// I need a function that will randomly choose a message from the arrays
// I need a function that will change the innerHTML of the output box
// I need querySelectors that will target the radio buttons and see if there
// value is checked
// I need a querySelector that will target the message button
// I need a querySelector that willt target the output box
// I need a class of hidden in css to show and hide the image in the output box
